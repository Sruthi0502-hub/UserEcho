📊 UserEcho – Website Traffic & User Behavior Analytics Tool

UserEcho is a website analytics system designed to track, store, and analyze user interactions on a website.
The project focuses on understanding how users behave, what pages they interact with, and how they navigate through a website, helping developers and product teams make data-driven decisions.

Instead of relying on third-party analytics tools, UserEcho provides a custom-built backend-driven solution that gives full control over data collection, storage, and visualization.

🎯 What This Project Does

UserEcho collects real-time user activity data from a website and processes it through a backend system.
It records essential interaction details such as:

Pages visited by users

Type of interaction (page view, click, scroll, etc.)

Time and frequency of visits

Device and browser information

User navigation patterns

All collected data is stored securely in a database and can later be used for analytics dashboards, reports, and insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend Framework: Python (Flask)
Lightweight and efficient REST API for receiving and processing tracking data.

Database: SQLite
Used for structured storage of user activity data (scalable to MySQL/PostgreSQL).

ORM / Database Layer: SQLAlchemy
Handles database interactions securely and cleanly.

API Design: RESTful APIs with JSON
Ensures smooth communication between frontend tracking scripts and backend.

Frontend Integration: JavaScript Tracking Script
Sends user interaction data to the backend using HTTP requests.
